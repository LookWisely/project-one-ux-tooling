            <h2>Chapter 1: THE UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING </h2>
            <p>At first, one might object to the notion of a multiverse, because it seems to violate known laws, such as the  conservation of matter andZ energy. However, the total matter/energy content of a universe may actually be very small. The matter content of the universe, including all the stars, planets, and galaxies, is huge and positive. However, the energy stored within gravity may be negative. If you add the positive energy due to matter to the negative energy due to gravity, the sum may be close to zero! In some sense, such universes are free.At first, one might object to the notion of a multiverse, because it seems to violate known laws, such as the conservation of matter and energy.

            <h2>Chapter 2: WHAT MIGIHT OTHER UNIVERSE LOOK LIKE?</h2>
          <p>The multiverse idea is appealing, because all we have to do is assume that spontaneous breaking occurs randomly. No other assumptions have to be made. Each time a universe sprouts off another universe, the physical constants differ from the original, creating new laws of physics. If this is true, then an entirely new reality can emerge within each universe. But this raises the intriguing question: whatdo these other universes look like? The key to understanding the physics of parallel universes is to understand how universes are created, that is, to understand precisely how spontaneous breaking occurs.When a universe is born and spontaneous breaking takes place,this also breaks the symmetry of the original theory. To a physicist, beauty means symmetry and simplicity. If a theory is beautiful, this means it has a powerful symmetry that can explain a large body of data in the most compact, economical manner</p>

            <h2>Chapter 3: SYMMETRY AND STANDARD MODEL</h2>
            <p> To understand what parallel universes might look like, we must first understand the symmetries of the strong, weak,and electromagnetic interactions. The strong force, for example, is based on three quarks, which scientists label by giving them a fictitious “color” (for example, red, white, and blue). We want the equations to remain the same if we interchange these three colored quarks. We say that the equations have SU(3) symmetry, that is,  when we reshuffle the three quarks, the equations remain the same. Scientists believe that a theory with SU(3) symmetry forms the most accurate description of the strong interactions (called Quantum Chromodynamics). If we had a gigantic supercomputer, starting with just the masses of the quarks and the strength of their interactions, we could, in theory, calculate all the properties of the proton and neutron and all the characteristics of nuclear physics.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 4: TESTABLE PREDICTIONS</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, the possibility of testing the multiverse theory, involving multiple universes with different sets of physical laws, is at present impossible. One would have to travel faster than light to reach these other universes. But one advantage of the inflation theory is that it makes predictions about the nature of our universe that are testable. Since the inflationary theory is a quantum theory, it is based on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the cornerstone of the quantum theory. (The uncertainty principle states that you cannot make measurements with infinite accuracy, such as measuring the velocity and position of an electron. No matter how sensitive your instruments are, there will always be uncertainty in your measurements. If you know an electron’s velocity, you cannot know its precise location; if you know its location, you cannot know its velocity.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 5: SUPERNOVA</h2>
            <p>While inflation turned out to be consistent with the COBE data scientists gathered, astronomers still grumbled in the 1990s that inflation was in flagrant violation of the experimental data on Omega. The tide first began to turn in 1998, as a result of data from a totally unexpected direction. Astronomers tried to recalculate the rate of expansion of the universe in the distant past. Instead of analyzing Cepheid variables, as Hubble did in the 1920s, they begin to examine supernovae in distant galaxies billions of light-years into the past. In particular, they examined type Ia supernovae, which are ideally suited for being used as standard candles. Astronomers know that supernovae of this type have nearly the same brightness. (The brightness of type Ia supernovae is known so well that even small deviations can be calibrated: the brighter the supernova, the slower it declines in brightness.)</p>

            <h2>Chapter 6: PHASES OF THE UNIVERSE</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the greatest contribution of the WMAP satellite is that it gives scientists confidence that they are headed toward a “Standard Model” of cosmology. Although huge gaps still exist, astrophysicists are beginning to see outlines of a standard theory emerging from the data. According to the picture we are putting together now, the evolution of the universe proceeded in distinct stages as it cooled. The transition from these stages represents the breaking of a symmetry and the splitting off of a force of nature.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 7: THE FUTURE</h2>
            <p>Although inflation is the theory today that has the power to explain such a wide range of mysteries about the universe, this does not prove that it is correct. (In addition, rival theories have recently been proposed, as we see in chapter 7.) The supernova result has to be checked and rechecked, taking into account factors such as dust and anomalies in the production of supernovae. The “smoking gun” that would finally verify or disprove the inflationary scenario are “gravity waves” that were produced at the instant of the big bang. These gravity waves, like the microwave background, should still be reverberating throughout the universe and may actually be found by gravity wave detectors, as we see in chapter 9. Inflation makes specific predictions about the nature of these gravity waves, and these gravity wave detectors should find them.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 8: WHAT MIGHT BE</h2>
            <p>General relativity is like a Trojan horse. On the surface, the theory is magnificent. With a few simple assumptions, one can obtain the general features of the cosmos, including the bending of starlight and the big bang itself, all of which have been measured to astonishing accuracy. Even inflation can be accommodated if we insert a cosmological constant by hand into the early universe. These solutions give us the most compelling theory of the birth and death of the universe. But lurking inside the horse, we find all sorts of demons and goblins, including black holes, white holes, wormholes, and even time machines, which defy common sense. These anomalies were considered so bizarre that even Einstein himself thought that they would never be found in nature.</p>
